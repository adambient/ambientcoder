# RunOut (Sinclair BASIC)

OutRun style game written in Sinclair BASIC just for fun. Uses a short machine code routine for fast attribute scroll defined in DATA statements, which scrolls one more character at a time each stage to simulate increasing speed. There are 5 stages - Track,  Beach, Night, City, Surf. Completing all stages completes the game.
