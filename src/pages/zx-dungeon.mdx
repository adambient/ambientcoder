# The Mysterious Labyrinth

This started as a bit of a (very basic) technical demo for the ZX Spectrum 48k and above (now requires 128k to support AY music and some unnecessary bank switching) which is now a completable game, using pipes and bars with attribute data to simulate smooth(ish) 4-way scrolling and avoiding colour clash.

.tap file for use with a ZX Spectrum emulator (tested with Fuse).
